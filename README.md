# hello-world
This is my entrance in the magical world of GitHub. I hope to learn a lot! :)
I am currently enrolled in a Ph.D program in Physics at the University of Parma, but my project is mainly carried out in Genova, where I have all the intrumentation I may need for performing my experiments. I am not sure if I would like to go on with a career in science research. I have to think about it since my time is running out very quickly :)
